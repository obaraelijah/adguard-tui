## About

---

## Getting Started

There are several options for running...

### Docker

### Executable

### Install from Crates.io

### Build from Source

### One-Liner

<details>

<summary><h4>Not sure which method to choose?</h4></summary>

- Docker is the easiest but adds a bit of overhead
- Where as using the executable won't require any additional dependencies
- If you've got Rust installed, fetching from crates.io will also be both easy and performant
- If you're system architecture isn't supported you'll need to build from source, as you also will if you wish to run a fork or make amendments to the code

</details>

## Configuring

The app requires the details of an AdGuard instance to connect to. This info can be provided either as environmental variables, or passed in as flag parameters. If any of these fields are missing or incomplete, you'll be prompted to enter a value once the app starts.

The following params are required:

- `ADGUARD_IP` - The IP address of your local AdGuard Home instance
- `ADGUARD_PORT` - The port that AdGuard is running on
- `ADGUARD_USERNAME` - An AdGuard Home username
- `ADGUARD_PASSWORD` - An AdGuard Home password

## Web Mode

The terminal dashboard can also be viewed via a browser, thanks to [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd).

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

You'll need Rust installed. Run: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` - see the [installation docs](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html). You'll also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), if you don't already have it.

Then clone the repo, and cd into it, with: `git clone git@github.com:obaraelijah/adguard-tui.git` && `cd adguard-tui`

### Run

To build and run the project for development, run `cargo run`

### Technical Docs

The documentation can be viewed at: 

### Testing and Quality

- `cargo test` - Run unit tests
- `cargo check` - Ensure app is compilable
- `cargo bench` - Execute benchmarks
- `cargo clippy` - Analyse areas for improvement
- `cargo doc` - Generate the documentation

### Building

Once your finished developing, you can build the project for production with: `cargo build --release`
The binaries for your system will then be available in the `./target/release/` directory of the project.
You can execute this directly, e.g. by running `./target/release/adguardian` (add .exe if on Windows)
