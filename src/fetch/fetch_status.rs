/// A `StatusResponse` is typically obtained like this:
///
/// ```
/// let client = reqwest::Client::new();
/// let hostname = "http://localhost:3000";
/// let username = "username";
/// let password = "password";
/// let status = fetch_adguard_status(&client, &hostname, &username, &password).await?;

///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `version` - The version of the AdGuard Home instance.
/// * `language` - The language currently used in the AdGuard Home instance.
/// * `dns_addresses` - The DNS addresses used by the AdGuard Home instance.
/// * `dns_port` - The port number on which the DNS server is running.
/// * `http_port` - The port number on which the HTTP server is running.
/// * `protection_disabled_duration` - The duration for which protection is disabled (in seconds).
/// * `protection_enabled` - Whether or not protection is currently enabled.
/// * `dhcp_available` - Whether or not DHCP is available.
/// * `running` - Whether or not the AdGuard Home instance is currently running.
